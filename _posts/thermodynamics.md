# Thermodynamics

One of the main aims of statistical mechanics is to explain the macroscopic behavior, which is described by the laws of 
thermodynamics, in terms of the interactions among the particles at the microscopic level. 

## Extensive variables : 
Suppose we take a box of volumne V with N identical particles and total energy E. If we now join the
two together, such that there is no sepration between them, we will have a box of size 2V, with 2N particles and energy 2E. 
Properties such as these, which scale with system size, are called extensive quantities.

One of the most important statements made in statistical mechanics is that there exists a quantity, called entropy, which is both extensive (as mentioned earlier) and concave(over any of its dependent quantities). It is denoted as :
`S (E,N,V)`

The other two properties of entropy are that it is a monotonically increasing function and that in a closed system, left on its own, entropy will only increase and never decrease. In equillibrium, entropy reaches its maximum value.

Let us now look at the derivatives of entropy with respect to the three dependent variables. Let us take a thermally insulated box that has a partition in the middle that allows only the exchange of energy (heat) between the two compartments.
