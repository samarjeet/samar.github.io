# Thermodynamics

One of the main aims of statistical mechanics is to explain the macroscopic behavior, which is described by the laws of 
thermodynamics, in terms of the interactions among the particles at the microscopic level. 

## Extensive variables : Suppose we take a box of volumne V with N identical particles and total energy E. If we now join the
two together, such that there is no sepration between them, we will have a box of size 2V, with 2N particles and energy 2E. 
Properties such as these are called extensive quantities as
